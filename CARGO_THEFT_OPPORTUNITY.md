- 3,625 cargo theft incidents (+27% YoY)
- $455 million in reported losses
- Average loss per incident: **$202,364**
- Recovery rate: **8-12%** (abysmal!)
- FBI estimate: **$15-30 billion** annually

## Why Existing Solutions Fail

### Current Approaches:

**1. GPS Tracking**
- **Problem:** Criminals disable GPS, switch license plates
- **Gap:** Not predictive, only reactive

**2. Manual Verification**
- **Problem:** Requires photos of CDL, truck numbers, etc.
- **Gap:** Slow, doesn't scale, human error

**3. Private Load Boards**
- **Problem:** Multi-factor authentication
- **Gap:** Still getting infiltrated, criminals create fake identities

**4. Insurance**
- **Problem:** Premiums skyrocketing
- **Gap:** Doesn't prevent theft, just compensates after

**5. Reporting Systems**
- **Problem:** Fragmented, no centralized visibility
- **Gap:** Can't see national trends

### Investment Despite Failure:

- **TQL invested $4 million** in technology and personnel
- **Still losing** - industry says fraud is "existential threat"
- Proves: (1) Willingness to pay, (2) Current tech doesn't work

---

## The Sophisticated Attack Patterns

### Strategic Theft (33% of incidents)

**Double Brokering Scam:**
1. Fake carrier books legitimate load
2. Re-brokers it to real carrier
3. Collects payment, never pays carrier
4. Disappears

**Identity Theft:**
- Steal legitimate carrier MC numbers
- Use stolen CDL photos
- Switch plates/truck numbers between pickups
- Target states not thought high-risk

**Document Fraud:**
- Fake bills of lading
- Forged pickup numbers
- Fake company registrations

### Evasion Tactics (2024)

Criminals have adapted to countermeasures:
- **Switch identities** between each pickup
- **Avoid California** (high scrutiny states)
- **Multi-day crime sprees** with central staging points
- **Use RMM tools** (ScreenConnect, SimpleHelp) to hack systems

---

## Why Now?

1. **Crisis level:** 600% increase = urgent need
2. **Failed incumbents:** TQL spent $4M, still losing
3. **AI ready:** Modern ML can detect fraud patterns
4. **Regulatory push:** DOT launching crackdown (tailwinds)
5. **Budget proven:** 1 in 4 brokers lost $200K+ (pain = $$$)

---

## Risk Factors

### Technical Risks:
- Criminals adapt quickly (cat & mouse game)
- Need continuous ML training

**Mitigation:** Focus on network effects, data moat

### Market Risks:
- Incumbents (CargoNet) could copy
- Adoption friction (industry slow to change)

**Mitigation:** Move fast, lock in top 100 brokers early

### Regulatory Risks:
- Data privacy (handling CDL, MC numbers)
- Potential liability if system fails

**Mitigation:** Legal review, insurance, clear ToS

**Uber Freight**: $3.3B acquisition by Aurora
**Project44**: $1.2B valuation
**Samsara** (IoT for fleets): $12B market cap (IPO 2021)

**Insight:** Large freight tech market, but execution matters

---

## Decision: Build This?

**Pros:**
- ✅ Massive pain ($15-30B problem)
- ✅ Budget validated (TQL spent $4M, brokers losing $200K+)
- ✅ Urgent (existential threat)
- ✅ Existing solutions failing
- ✅ B2B with clear customer segment
- ✅ Recurring revenue potential

**Cons:**
